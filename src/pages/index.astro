                            Thermal hotspots in photovoltaic modules are a leading cause of performance loss, accelerated
                            degradation, and safety concerns, making timely and scalable detection essential for modern solar
                            farm operations. This article presents a hybrid approach that combines classical computer vision
                            with deep learning to analyze radiometric thermal imagery, demonstrating that complementary methods
                            can be orchestrated to balance interpretability, robustness, and speed. The proposed workflow
                            emphasizes rapid prototyping and modularity, enabling practitioners to assemble a practical
                            end-to-end pipeline—from data capture and preprocessing through candidate generation,
                            classification, and reporting—using readily available tools and modest datasets. Designed for
                            integration with existing monitoring systems, the workflow outputs per-module alerts, normalized
                            severity indicators, and artifacts suitable for operations and maintenance decision-making at
                            scale. Empirical results show that the combined strategy improves detection reliability over
                            single-family methods while preserving transparency in how anomalies are identified, supporting
                            both quick pilots and production-ready deployments across handheld, drone, and fixed installations.

                        <p class="text-md font-light text-justify">
                            These results were obtained by training a YOLO11n model using the Ultralytics library, which
                            provides an out-of-the-box interface for rapid iteration and training across multiple model
                            architectures. The model was evaluated on an AI-generated video created with Google Veo 3, due to
                            the lack of publicly available datasets containing infrared cinematography of solar panels. Initial
                            observations indicate that the model performs reasonably well, detecting most hotspots in the video
                            while missing several others. This is likely attributable to the compact size of the trained model
                            and a potential domain mismatch, as the training data may originate from solar panel imagery with
                            different characteristics.
